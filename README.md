What makes SafeGuard different?
----

A major difference we can state as compared to other anti-cheat plugins, is the minimal amount of false-positives, while retaining its brute-force checks on cheaters, making it frustrating for the cheaters to even cheat once during the game! A plugin may have strict checks, which will prevent cheaters, however, this also affects normal players, which is something our team strongly disagrees with. We want to create a plugin that does not alter normal game-play, and forces cheaters to adhere by normal game-play, without sacrificing the players who are playing legitimately.
